MageSpeedTest.com is a free service to simulate multiple customers on your webstore and test the speed. This extension will help you create your sitemap.xml file and run your first test. 

Monitoring Your Store
----------------------
You can configure periodic speed monitoring and receive an alert if your speed test results have changed dramatically - which can be an early indicator of problems.

Premium Testing
---------------
With Premium Subscriber accounts you can test from multiple locations and with more users for longer durations. You can also monitor more sites, and access the monitor API. 

A premium subscription is $9 per month and gives these benefits:

* Global Testing
* Longer, more stressful testing
* No cooldown period, useful when tuning and tweaking
* Repeat tests
* More monitoring
* Monitoring API access
